        <div><center> Flotsam was created to help educate and inform people everywhere of the increasing danger we pose to all types of sea life, especially sea turtles. Nearly every species of sea turtles are classified as endangered. While only hunters and fishers kill the turtles directly, each and every person indirectly contributes to killing another 1000 sea turtles each year with the trash they generate. Turtles, who eat jellyfish, confuse plastic bags for prey and choke; they get entangled in nets and discarded drink rings; they suffocate on straws. In Flotsam, you step into the role of a sea turtle as it tries to navigate the wasteland that has become its home, and try and survive in the environment it never asked for. </center></div>
