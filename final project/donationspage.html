      <p>
        If you’re looking to help save the sea turtles and are into walking the paths of Buddhist pilgrims and swim the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean, this may be the perfect sea turtle adventure for you.As a volunteer, you’ll work in Ambalangoda, a beautiful town on the ocean where one of the main industries is fishing. Sadly, sea turtles often become caught in nets from fisherman and lose their limbs. Once disabled, these turtles cannot live in the wild, so many Sri Lankan’s rescue them and are able to move them to the project site where they can be cared for and rehabilitated.
